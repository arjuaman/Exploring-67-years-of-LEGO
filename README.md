Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not.

In this project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!

1> I started by reading in the colors data to get a sense of the diversity of lego sets!

2> Then proceeded with nderstanding the number of colors available.

3> Explored the distribution of transparent vs. non-transparent colors.

4> Explored how the average number of parts in Lego sets has varied over the years.

5> Explored how the number of themes shipped has varied over the years.
